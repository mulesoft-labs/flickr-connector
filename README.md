Cloud Connector for Flickr
==========================

A Flickr Cloud Connector that allows users to search and download photos.

Installation
------------

The connector can either be installed for all applications running within the Mule instance or can be setup to be used
for a single application.

*All Applications*

Download the connector from the link above and place the resulting jar file in
/lib/user directory of the Mule installation folder.

*Single Application*

To make the connector available only to single application then place it in the
lib directory of the application otherwise if using Maven to compile and deploy
your application the following can be done:

Add the connector's maven repo to your pom.xml:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>muleforge-releases</id>
            <name>MuleForge Snapshot Repository</name>
            <url>https://repository.muleforge.org/release/</url>
            <layout>default</layout>
        </repsitory>
    </repositories>

Add the connector as a dependency to your project. This can be done by adding
the following under the <dependencies> element in the pom.xml file of the
application:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
        <artifactId>mule-module-flickr</artifactId>
        <version>1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Search
------

Return a list of photos matching some criteria. Only photos visible to the calling user will be returned. To return
private or semi-private photos, the caller must be authenticated with 'read' permissions, and have permission to

|privacyFilter|   Return photos only matching a certain privacy level. This only applies when making an authenticated call to view photos you own. Valid values are:
                       <p/>
                       1 public photos
                       2 private photos visible to friends

                       Longitude has a range of -180 to 180 , latitude of -90 to 90. Defaults to -180, -90, 180, 90 if not specified.
                       <p/>
                       Unlike standard photo queries, geo (or bounding box) queries will only return 250 results per page.
                       <p/>
                       Geo queries require some sort of limiting agent in order to prevent the database from crying. This is basically like the check against "parameterless searches" for queries without a geo component.
                       <p/>
                       A tag, for instance, is considered a limiting agent as are user defined min_date_taken and min_date_upload parameters ï¿½ If no limiting factor is passed we return only photos added in the last 12 hours (though we may extend the limit in the future).|yes||
|accuracy|        (Optional)
                       Recorded accuracy level of the location information. Current range is 1-16 :

                       World level is 1
                       Country is ~3
                       Region is ~6
                       City is ~11
                       Street is ~16
                       <p/>
                       Defaults to maximum value if not specified.|yes||
|safeSearch|      (Optional)
                       Safe search setting:
                       <p/>
                       1 for safe.
                       2 for moderate.
                       3 for restricted.
                       <p/>
                       (Please note: Un-authed calls can only see Safe content.)|yes||
|contentType|     Content Type setting:
                       <p/>
                       1 for photos only.
                       2 for screenshots only.
                       3 for 'other' only.
                       4 for photos and screenshots.
                       5 for screenshots and 'other'.
                       6 for photos and 'other'.
                       7 for photos, screenshots, and 'other' (all).
                       <p/>|yes||
|machineTags|     Aside from passing in a fully formed machine tag, there is a special syntax for searching on specific properties :
                       <p/>
                       Find photos using the 'dc' namespace : "machine_tags" => "dc:"
                       Find photos with a title in the 'dc' namespace : "machine_tags" => "dc:title="
                       Find photos titled "mr. camera" in the 'dc' namespace : "machine_tags" => "dc:title=\"mr. camera\"
                       Find photos whose value is "mr. camera" : "machine_tags" => "*:*=\"mr. camera\""
                       Find photos that have a title, in any namespace : "machine_tags" => "*:title="
                       Find photos that have a title, in any namespace, whose value is "mr. camera" : "machine_tags" => "*:title=\"mr. camera\""
                       Find photos, in the 'dc' namespace whose value is "mr. camera" : "machine_tags" => "dc:*=\"mr. camera\""
                       <p/>
                       Multiple machine tags may be queried by passing a comma-separated list. The number of machine tags you can pass in a single query depends on the tag mode (AND or OR) that you are querying with. "AND" queries are limited to (16) machine tags. "OR" queries are limited to (8).|yes||
